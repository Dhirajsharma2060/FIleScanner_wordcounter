Objective: The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate your skills
in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable Go code.
Instructions:
You are tasked with building a simple command-line tool that performs
the following tasks:


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 1: File Scanner
Create a Go program that scans a given directory and its
subdirectories for text files.
For each text file found, the program should print the filename and
